A Tinker's Construct ripoff made by some guy who hates every single one of the mods that you even sort of like, and also probably had sex with at least one of your parents.

Kidding. Adventurer's Toolbox is a small mod that allows you to make custom tools out of a variety of different parts. Comparisons to Tinker's Construct are inevitable, but Adventurer's Toolbox is much simpler, much smaller, and less powerful than Tinker's Construct.

To get started with the mod, just craft any tool head and read the book that you subsequently receive.
